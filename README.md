# Eco$ave

### Idea Pitch
A web application that allows people to see how much money they save through their eco-friendly choices.

### Idea Description
Our idea is to create a web-based application to motivate users to make more eco-friendly choices by showing how much money they will save as a result of their choice of daily activities, such as purchasing local grown produce, cooking a meal rather than ordering it, bringing reusable bags when purchasing groceries, and walking/biking rather than driving. The tool will also provide recommendations to areas of improvements one could make to further reduce their carbon footprint and expenses in the long term based on their lifestyle/activities performed.

### What motivated you to go with this project?
Climate change is a growing issue that requires all our collected effort to fix. While environmental organizations and NGOs, such as WHO, promotes the idea of reducing carbon footprints, many people donâ€™t understand what that actually means. We think this project can help educate and encourage individuals how their eco-friendly choices can not only affect the Earth but also affect themselves. By communicating the financial benefit of making environmentally conscious choices, it could greatly motivate a user to rethink the impact of their daily decisions on the environment especially if they are interested in saving money.

### How impactful is your innovation!
The tool will not only help individuals with internet access make more economic and eco-friendly choices, but will also help make the globe and the environment more sustainable at the larger scale. An impact of this tool is that it turns an issue which can feel distant and abstract into something that is quantifiable and easily understood. Not only would users be encouraged to think about making environmentally conscious choices on a daily basis, it opens opportunities for users to justify environmentally friendly changes to their lifestyle to others.

### What is your envisioned solution?
We envision a simple to use button system where users can tap from a selection of environmentally conscious choices they made during the day. A numerical sum and a visual representation of the total amount of money saved will be visible for the day, as well as over a period of time.

### What is the potential for impact of the idea?
We see the potential of this app to be deployed on devices like smart watches, phones, and even in cars. By making users aware of how they use resources throughout the day, the aim is to remind people of their continuous impact on the environment.
